# The Collatz Conjecture

Generate and display Collatz sequences for integers entered by the user.

## Task
- Read an integer `n` from the user
- Display the Collatz sequence starting with `n` and ending with 1
- Continue reading new values until user enters `n` ≤ 0

## The Collatz Sequence Algorithm
1. Start with any positive integer `n`
2. While `n` is not equal to 1:
   - If `n` is even: divide by 2 (floor division)
   - If `n` is odd: multiply by 3 and add 1
3. The sequence ends when `n` reaches 1

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```

**Example 2:**
